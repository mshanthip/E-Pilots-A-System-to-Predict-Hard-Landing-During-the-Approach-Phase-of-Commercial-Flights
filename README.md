                           E-Pilots: A System to Predict Hard Landing During the Approach Phase of Commercial Flights

Overview:-

E-Pilots is an advanced predictive system designed to analyze flight parameters and assess the risk of a hard landing during the approach phase of commercial flights. By leveraging machine learning models and real-time data processing, the system provides early warnings to pilots and flight operators, enhancing flight safety and reducing aircraft wear and tear.

Features:-

      - Real-time Prediction: Monitors and predicts the likelihood of a hard landing during the approach phase.
      
      - Machine Learning-Based Analysis: Utilizes historical flight data and AI models to enhance prediction accuracy.
      
      - Pilot and Operator Alerts: Sends early warnings to pilots and ground operators to take corrective actions.
      
      - Data Visualization: Provides graphical insights into flight parameters contributing to landing conditions.
      
      - Integration Capabilities: Compatible with flight management systems and aviation analytics tools.

System Architecture

The E-Pilots system is composed of the following modules:

    1.Data Collection: Gathers real-time flight data, including altitude, airspeed, vertical speed, and wind conditions.
    
    2.Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Cleans and prepares data for analysis, extracting key features relevant to landing conditions.
    
    3.Machine Learning Model: Predicts the risk of a hard landing based on trained AI algorithms (SVM, Logistic Regression, and LSTM).
    
    4.Alert System: Notifies pilots and flight operators when the risk threshold is exceeded.
    
    5.Visualization & Reporting: Displays predictive insights in an intuitive dashboard.
